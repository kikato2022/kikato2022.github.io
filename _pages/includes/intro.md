# 🎊 Welcome to my website!

My name is Kai Li (Chinese name: 李凯). I'm a third-year master student at Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, supervised by Prof. [Xiaolin Hu (胡晓林)](http://www.xlhu.cn/). I am also a member of [TSAIL Group](https://ml.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/) directed by Prof. [Bo Zhang (张拨)](https://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1121/3552.htm) and Prof. [Jun zhu (朱军)](https://ml.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~jun/index.shtml).

I am an intern at Tencent AI Lab <img src='images/Tencent.png' style='width: 3.5em;'>, mainly doing research on causal speech separation, supervised by [Yi Luo (罗艺)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OSM9xooAAAAJ&hl=en).

I got my bachelor's degree from Department of Computer Technology and Application, Qinghai University, supervised by Prof. [Jianqiang Huang (黄建强)](https://www.qhu-hdacp.cn/hjq.html) and Prof. [Chunmei Li (李春梅)](https://cs.qhu.edu.cn/jxgz/jxysz/ssyjsds/57658.htm)

🤗 &nbsp; These works are open source to the best of my ability.

🤗 &nbsp; I am currently doing research on Source Separation, and am interested in other speech tasks (e.g., pre-training models and neuralscience). If you would like to collaborate, please contact me. Many thanks.
