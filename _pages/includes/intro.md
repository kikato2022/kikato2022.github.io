#  Welcome to my website!

My name is Kikato (Chinese name: 牟成杰). 

I am now a graduate student at [Visual Computing Research Center](https://vcc.szu.edu.cn/index.html), Shenzhen University, under the guidance of Prof. [Ruizhen Hu](https://csse.szu.edu.cn/staff/ruizhenhu/)

I got my bachelor's degree from the Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, supervised by Prof. [Pin Tao (陶品)](https://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1117/3542.htm).

I am now interested in Computer Graphics and Robotics, especially in human-object interaction and object manipulation.
